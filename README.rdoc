Impressi is an interface that makes it easy for users to make presentations with {Impress.js}[http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/].  It's now available to use at {Impress.me}[http://impress.me]  It was built as a project for {DevBootcamp}[http://devbootcamp.com] ({Github page}[https://github.com/Devbootcamp]) by the following contributors:

* {Craig Little}[https://github.com/craiglittle]  
* {Adam Biagianti}[https://github.com/el-mapache]  
* {Shail Patel}[https://github.com/shailpatel2]  
* {Silas Barta}[https://github.com/SilasX] (no relation to the impress.js creator)  
* {Kush Patel}[https://github.com/kushpatel72]  
* Melissa Lamoreaux

Right now it supports selecting a template, inputting text, and adding/deleting slides.  The template object is currently set up so that each transition to the next slide uses the same transformation.

== Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to Impressi! Please fork and submit a pull request.  Features we would like are:

* an interface for producing custom templates,
* extension of the template class to allow for different kinds of transformations in the same presentation,
* image/video-adding capability, and
* rich text editing on the slides, especially involving the 3D capabilities of Impress.js/CSS3.
